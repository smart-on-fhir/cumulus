# Cumulus

**A Universal Sidecar for a SMART Learning Healthcare System.**

Cumulus builds from existing standards and open health IT tools to offer turnkey functions to
annotate FHIR data for analytics, de-identify data, and query for cohorts,
enabling rapid learning within a healthcare system.

Using Cumulus, you can:

* Place a ‘listener’ within the provider’s firewall, that connects to the
  [SMART/HL7 Bulk Data API](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/)
* Perform key functions, including de-identification and natural language processing of notes
* Extract data and populate an analytic FHIR environment

If you have any questions about the project,
