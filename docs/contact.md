# How to Reach Us

## Getting Support

If you have any questions about Cumulus, whether you've used it before or not, our
[Discussions](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/cumulus/discussions) forum is a good place to ask.

## Reporting a Bug

If you are using Cumulus and hit a bug or a problem,
[file an Issue](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/cumulus/issues/new),
and we will help diagnose it.

## Finding the Right Subproject

Don't stress about filing a question or issue in the correct place.
We'll happily respond regardless, and move it if necessary.

- Cumulus ETL: the [cumulus-etl](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/cumulus-etl) project
- Cumulus Library: the [cumulus-library](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/cumulus-library) project
